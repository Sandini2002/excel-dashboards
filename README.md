# Excel Dashboards Portfolio

Welcome to my Excel Dashboards repository! 📊

This is where I upload all my Excel dashboard projects and files related to data analytics. Each folder contains:

- 📁 Excel workbooks
- 📷 Dashboard screenshots
- 📄 Project insights and notes

I use Excel to analyze datasets, create visual dashboards, and gain business insights from real-world data. These projects are part of my learning journey as a Business Analyst student passionate about data-driven decision making.

Stay tuned for more updates!
